Ruby Basics
===========

Familiarize yourself with Ruby since you will be seeing a lot of these in the future!

Here are a few conventions that you should remember throughout the course:

**$** - When you see a **$** at the beginning it means run the command directly on your command prompt.

**>** - When you see a **>** at the beginning it means run the command on the Ruby shell. That means run `irb` first on your command prompt.

Hello World!
------------
      $ ruby -e 'puts "Hello World"'
      Hello World

We can put it in a file, `hello.rb`.

      puts "Hello World"

Run it with `ruby`.

      $ ruby hello.rb
      Hello World


Strings
-------

`"Hello World"` is a string. `"Hello World".class` returns `String`.

      > puts "Hello World".class #=> String
