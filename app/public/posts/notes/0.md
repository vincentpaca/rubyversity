Development Environment
=======================

Here are the following tools you'll need to get started with Ruby!

For now, we'll be using Windows as our development environment to make it easier for everyone.

##Downloadables

1. Download the latest [Ruby Installer](http://cdn.rubyinstaller.org/archives/1.9.3-p327/rubyinstaller-1.9.3-p327.exe). Make sure your
Ruby Installer version is Ruby-1.9.3-p327.

2. After installation verify your ruby installation by running your Windows Command prompt and typing `irb`. It should show you that you
are now inside the ruby interactive shell. You can try out commands like `puts "Hello World"` for example.

##Text Editors

There are a lot of text editors but in my opinion here are the best that's out there.

####[Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/)
Sublime Text is fast and has a slick UI and great markup and syntax highlighting for Ruby.

####[Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
Notepad++ is simple and **VERY** lightweight.

####[VIM](http://www.vim.org/)
VIM is my favorite text editor and it's not for the faint of heart.
