=================

For this first homework, you will do some simple programming exercises to familiarize yourself with Ruby.

**How to submit**: Email your solutions to __vincent.paca[at]gmail[dot]com__ (zipped, tarballed, 7zipped, however you like it).

##Part 1: Strings

(a) Write a method that determines if a word or phrase is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word that reads the same
as backwards as forwards ignoring case, punctuation and other non word characters. Your code **SHOULD NOT** contain any loops or iterations of any kind.

Check out the [Ruby documentation](http://ruby-doc.org) for methods like `String#downcase`, `String#gsub` and `String#reverse`.

For example:

    palindrome?("A but tuba.") #=> true
    palindrome?("Not a palindrome") #=> false
    palindrome?("A man, a plan, a canal: Panama") #=> true

    def palindrome?
      #write your awesome code here
    end

(b) Given an input sttring, return a hash whose keys are the words in the string and the values are the number of times each word
appears. Non-words should be ignored. Case should not matter.

Example:

    count_words("Pap parap pap pap love ko to")
    #=> { "pap" => 3, "parap" => 1, "love" => 1, "ko" => 1, "to" => 1 }

    def count_words(string)
      #write your code here
    end
